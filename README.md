# makehuman.js

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="data/screenshot.png" />

  An **experimental** port of [Makehuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org) to Typescript/The Web.
</div>

## Current Status

* Have a look at [build 2022-08-11](https://markandre13.github.io/makehuman.js/) with toad.js branch table3
* All modifiers work and update the mesh.
* Nothing else... ðŸ˜…

## Why?

* I've been using MakeHuman for more than a decade but often struggled with the UI and the source code.
* I'm up to [something](https://mark13.org) with [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and [Chordata](https://chordata.cc) and in need for full artistic control of my toolchain. ðŸ˜Ž
