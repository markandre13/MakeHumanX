# makehuman.js

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="data/screenshot.png" />

  An **experimental** port of [Makehuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org) to Typescript/The Web.
</div>

## Current Status

* Totally unusable work in progress. ðŸ˜…
* As of 2021-06-06 I succeeded to make some modifiers work.
* The UI is done with [toad.js](https://github.com/markandre13/toad.js#readme) and needs the variant in git master.
  (Say "Hi!" to `npm link`)

## Why?

* I've been using MakeHuman for more than a decade but often struggled with the UI and the source code.
* I'm up to [something](https://mark13.org) with [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and [Chordata](https://chordata.cc) and in need for full artistic control of my toolchain. ðŸ˜Ž
