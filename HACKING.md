# How does MakeHuman work?

## Mesh (Modelling Tab)

Mesh of a human body, which can be adjusted using pre-defined morph targets.

### Data

* data/3d/objs/base.obj mesh human body in Wavefront Object format (1.7M)
* data/targets/**/*.target morph targets for the mesh (125M)
* modifiers/modeling_modifiers.json
  assigns morph targets to modifiers
* modifiers/modeling_sliders.json 
  defines how modifiers are placed in the UI

(data as text is about 127M, compressed with zlib about 37.7M)

### Code

#### Control Flow

* Slider -> Modifier.setValue(value)
* Modifier -> Human.setDetail(morphTargetName, value)
* Human -> HumanMesh apply Human's morph targets to the mesh

#### Source

* startup: core/mhmain.py
* Human: apps/human.py
* modifiers: apps/humanmodifier.py.

  SimpleModifier extends Modifier
  ManagedTargetModifier extends Modifier
  UniversalModifier extends ManagedTargetModifier
  MacroModifier extends ManagedTargetModifier
  EthnicModifier extends MacroModifier


## Skeleton (Pose/Animate Tab)

Skeleton/rigs for the mesh.

* shared/skeleton.py

## Topology

Alternative meshes.
# Observing the Python implementation

## Observing

* add print statements
* run the app from the command line with
  ~/Downloads/MakeHuman.app/Contents/MacOS/MakeHuman

## Preparation

* downloaded the MacOS version of MakeHuman into ~/Downloads
* to track changes, I created a git repository in
  Downloads/MakeHuman.app/Contents/Resources/makehuman/
* for the output of print statements to be visible on the command line,
  I disabled the call to redirect_standard_streams() in
  ~/Downloads/MakeHuman.app/Contents/Resources/makehuman.py

# Other

## Animation

* importing an animation (bhv, collada) will create a new object wose animation needs to be copied onto the object to be animated:
  * select destination
  * shift select source
  * Ctrl + L
  * Link Animation Data
  * (optional: Object > Relations > Make Single User > Object Animation)
* export/import an animation with blender
  * bhv will loose the curves and use samples instead
  * collada needs to be configured properly but will retain the curves
    (and for three bones with two keyed rotations, Blender generates about 1100 lines of
    XML with super long ids... ðŸ«¢)
* Blender has a built in [pose library](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/armatures/posing/editing/pose_library.html)

## makehuman-0.9.1-rc1a

this old C++ version of MakeHuman has many interesting features:

* rig constraints
* key shapes for muscles
* weights were of higher quality
* a human skeleton mesh

the sources though are a bit hard to find these days.

I've found [MyHumanoid](https://github.com/MyHumanoid/MyHumanoid) and was able to compile it but couldn't get it to run because of OpenGL issues:

```
   # need to put src/MhUiMorph.cpp: put applier and nopApplier into namespace { ... }
   apt-get install cmake
   cmake -S MyHumanoid -B humanoid
   cd humanoid
   make
   ./MyHumanoid
```

I've been able to find and build the original source, but the exported Collada file
does not contain weights
